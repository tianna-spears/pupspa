This is a project from the Codecademy Front-End Developer Career Path. The purpose of this project is to practice CSS design using CSS Grid. The goal of this project is to build a classic, grid-based, responsive web page.

This is Unit 2/5 of the Front-End Developer Career Path, Improved Styling with CSS.

Project provided style.css and index.html code. I edited the provided information to style the website using CSS Grid.
